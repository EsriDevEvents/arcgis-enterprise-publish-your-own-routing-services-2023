## Repository description
This repository contains resource to the "ArcGIS Enterprise: Publish Your Own Routing Services" technical session at Esri Developer Summit 2023.

[TravelDirections](TravelDirections) contains the project and data used to demonstrate publish custom routing services. You can find the documentation for this example [here](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/networks/gettraveldirections-geoprocessing-service-example.htm).

[publish-web-tool](publish-web-tool) contains a utility to automate the running of the tool and publishing of the web tool.

## Session description
Need the functionality of the ArcGIS Online Routing Services in your own infrastructure? We will discuss the different types of routing services available with ArcGIS Enterprise and how to publish them. The session will also cover how to create fast, customized routing services by creating your own geoprocessing services from script tools written in Python.  If you have previously created routing services using a map server object extension, this session will show you an alternative that achieves the same workflow using geoprocessing services.
